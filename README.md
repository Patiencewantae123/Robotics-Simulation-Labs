## 🎯 Objectives and Content

This project supports an introductory robotics course for electrical engineering students, focusing on wheeled mobile robots. Originally developed during the COVID-19 restrictions, the labs have grown from 4 to 7, covering topics such as:

- 🌐 Webots Robot Simulator and Python
- 🤖 Programming mobile robots
- 🔄 Finite-State Machines
- 🚧 Obstacle Avoidance
- 🔧 Kinematics of differential-drive robots
- 📍 Odometry-based robot localization
- 🎯 Go-to-Goal behavior using PID controller
- 📈 Non-linear trajectory tracking controller
- 🛠 Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) simulation

Python 3 templates and solutions (or MicroPython for HIL) are provided for selected labs.

## 🛠 How to Use

The labs are structured as sequential tutorials, starting with installation and configuration. Each tutorial references official Webots resources for a smooth learning experience.  

- Compatible with Webots (R2022a or newer). For older versions, refer to [this note](/coordinate_system/ReadMe.md).
