# Robotics Simulation Labs
Here you will find a set of tutorials to practice robotics concepts with [Webots Open-Source Robot Simulator](https://cyberbotics.com/) and Python. 

## Motivation and Objectives
The simulation labs were created to replace the lab activities from my Robotics course due to the Corona-related restrictions of 2020/2021. This is an introductory level course on Robotics for engineering students, focusing on wheeled mobile robots. The main goal of the lab activities is to practice:

 - Basic concepts of Webots Robot Simulator
 - Basic sensors
 - Differential drive kinematics
 - State-machine behavior
 - Odometry-based robot localization
 - Trajectory tracking controller

Solution code is presented in Python 3.

## How to use
The simulation labs are presented as a series of tutorials, including references to the official Webots tutorials. The Labs are intended to be followed in sequence, starting from the first one. If you already have Webots and Python 3 installed, and are already familiar with Webots, you can skip Lab 1.

## Content
The content of each lab is listed below:

- [Lab 1](/Lab1/ReadMe.md) - Installation and introduction to Webots Robot Simulator
- [Lab 2](/Lab2/ReadMe.md) - Line-following behavior with State-Machine
- [Lab 3](/Lab3/ReadMe.md) - Odometry-based Localization
- [Lab 4](/Lab4/ReadMe.md) - Trajectory Tracking Controller
- [Lab 5](/Lab5/ReadMe.md) - Robot Soccer Team
