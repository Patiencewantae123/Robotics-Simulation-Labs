# Robotics Simulation Labs
Here you will find a set of tutorials to practice robotics concepts with [Webots Open-Source Robot Simulator](https://cyberbotics.com/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/).

## Motivation and Objectives
The simulation labs were created to replace the lab activities from my Robotics course due to the Corona-related restrictions of 2020/2021. This is an introductory level course on Robotics for engineering students, focusing on wheeled mobile robots. The main goal of the lab activities is to learn/improve knowledge of:

 - Webots Robot Simulator and Python
 - Features of commercial mobile robots
 - State-machines
 - Obstacle avoidance
 - Kinematics of differential-drive robots
 - Odometry-based robot localization
 - Go-to-Goal behavior using PID controller
 - Non-linear trajectory tracking controller

Templates and solutions are presented in Python 3.

## How to use
The simulation labs are presented as a series of tutorials, including references to the official Webots tutorials. The Labs are intended to be followed in sequence, starting from the first one.

## Content
The content of each lab is listed below:

- [Lab 1](/Lab1/ReadMe.md) - Installation and configuration of Webots and Python
- [Lab 2](/Lab2/ReadMe.md) - Line-following behavior with State-Machine
- [Lab 3](/Lab3/ReadMe.md) - Odometry-based Localization
- [Lab 4](/Lab4/ReadMe.md) - Trajectory Tracking Controller
- [Lab 5](/Lab5/ReadMe.md) - Combine Behaviors to Execute a Complex Task
- [Lab 6](/Lab6/ReadMe.md) - Robot Soccer Team
